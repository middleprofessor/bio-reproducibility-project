RCN -

Frame it as how will it advance the science, not just identifying the problems. It has to improve things, recommendations, best practices

Sam Scheiner recommendations
1. take what I've done, compile results summarizing breadth and frequency of errors. think about scope of activity. What is outcome I want to get to and what is people and time effort. Write up a couple of pages describing what this activity would be - ultimate goal and how to get there (people, over what period of time, how much money to spend to bring people together), get back of envelope costs and send to Sam - who will pass around and ask about reactions. Go from there.The broader that I make the literature, the more programs or more pots of money. Activty to disseminate the results - bring together journal editors, for example.
