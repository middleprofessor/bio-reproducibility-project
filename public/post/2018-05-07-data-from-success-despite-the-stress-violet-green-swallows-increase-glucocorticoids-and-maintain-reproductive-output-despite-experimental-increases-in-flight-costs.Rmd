# Data
```{r}
fn <- 'RiversetalVGSWhandicappingRawData.xls'
file_path <- paste(base_path, folder, fn, sep='/')
bird <- data.table(read_excel(file_path, sheet = 'Tab3 "a8"'))
bird[, Treatment:=factor(Treatment)]
bird[, Capture_Period:=factor(Nestling_Age)]
bird_wide <- dcast(bird,  Year + Treatment + BandNo + DOY_Initiation + day3mass ~ Capture_Period, value.var=c('Mass','Time'))
bird_wide[, dMass:=Mass_13 - Mass_3]
```

# Reproducibility
## Body Mass
>We found that female body mass significantly decreased between the two capture periods (F1,14.7 = 48.9, P < 0 001; Fig. 2b), but we did not detect a significant effect of either treatment (F2,23 = 1.9, P = 0.173) or a treatment x capture period interaction (F2,15 = 2.5, P = 0.118).

```{r fig2b, fig.cap="Reproduced Fig. 2b."}
# capture period == nestling_age
gg <- ggplot(data=bird, aes(x=Treatment, y=Mass, fill=Capture_Period)) +
  geom_boxplot()
gg
fit <- lmer(Mass ~ Treatment*Capture_Period + (1|BandNo), data=bird)
kable(as.data.frame(anova(fit, ddf="Kenward-Roger")), digits=3)
```

> We found that female body mass significantly decreased between the two capture periods (F1,14.7 = 48.9, P < 0.001; Fig. 2b), but we did not detect a significant effect of either treatment (F2,23 = 1.9, P = 0.173) or a treatment x capture period interaction (F2,15 = 2 5, P = 0.118). The mean decrease in body mass between capture periods was significant for females in the control treatment [b = -0.95 (95% CI:  1.75,  0.14), t1,16 = 3.8, P = 0 017] as well as both handicapping treatments [light clipping: b = -1.07 (95% CI:  1.88,  0.26), t1,15 3 = 4.3, P = 0.007; heavy clipping: b = -2.12 (95% CI:  3.67,  0.58), t1,14 3 = 4.5, P = 0.005; Fig. 2b]. However, the magnitude of decrease in mean body mass of females in the light and heavy clipping treatments was 1.29X (95% CI: 0.6, 2.3) and 2.29X (95% CI: 1.2, 4.5) greater, respectively, that of females in the control treatment.

# Red Flags
## No adjustment for baseline when comparing change in mass
Note the inconsistency between the report of 1.29X and 2.29X greater reduction in mass with CIs that do not cover 1.0 and the ANOVA table interaction row (both are different ways of looking at the same thing). Fig 2b shows effectively zero effect of treatment for post-treatment measure. The expectation is zero if there is no effect, and the data are very consistent with this. But there is a big difference in pre-treatment mass among levels (again, the expectation is zero with randomized treatment assignment). So this is a good example of pre-post bias in the estimates of 1.29X and 2.29X greater reduction in mass. [The expectation for these estimates is not 1.0 conditional on pre-treatment mass](https://www.middleprofessor.com/files/quasipubs/change_scores.html). Why might pre-treatment control mass be unusually low or pre-treatment 8-clip mass be unusually high? This could simply be a function of when the birds were weighed, since bird mass oscillates during the day.
