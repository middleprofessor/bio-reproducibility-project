Experimental design of a "bird exclosure" experiment conducted at Jonkershoek 
on December 2014 (six year old vegetation (post-fire age)).

There were 6 sites distributed on two slopes ("north" and "south"), each site including 3 treatments: cage exclosure (20m x 20m x 2m), open control plot (20m x 20m) 
and two shade control roofs (7 x 10m). Cage and open plots were subdivided into 16 parts (5m x 5m; numbered 1 to 16), 
themselves subdivided into 4 parts (2.5m x 2.5m; "top right", "top left", "bottom right" and "bottom left"). 
In each site, 8 quadrats were randomly chosen and sampled in each cage exclosure and open control plots 
and 4 under the shade control roofs.
- Samples labelled X-X-XXX (e.g. 6-O-7TR, 6-C-7TR, 6-S1TR)
- The first number is the site number (1 to 6; six sites)
- The letters "O", "C" and "S", refers to "open control plot", "cage exclosure" and "shade control roof"
- "TR", "TL", "BR" and "BL" are short for "top right", "top left", "bottom right" and "bottom left"
