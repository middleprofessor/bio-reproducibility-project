The Biology Reproducibility Project is an archive of R scripts re-analysing published datasets, mostly from Dryad Digital Repository. The project started as a means to archive data and analyses for my undergraduate biostatistics class and developing textbook.

**What is reproducible research?** "I define *replication* as independent people going out and collecting new data and *reproducibility* as independent people analyzing the same data" ([Roger Peng](https://simplystatistics.org/2011/12/02/reproducible-research-in-computational-science/))

Caveat that I include on each post: Failure to reproduce (level 1) or partial reproducibility (level 2 or 3-) very well might be an error in my coding, or my misunderstanding of the author's methods, or my lack of knowledge of statistics generally or the R functions that I use more specifically. Similarly, my **Red Flags** may also represent my own lack of knowledge or best practices in statistics.

All scripts are written by [Jeffrey A. Walker](https://www.middleprofessor.com)
