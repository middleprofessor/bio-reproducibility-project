# Data
```{r}
fn <- 'RiversetalVGSWhandicappingRawData.xls'
file_path <- paste(base_path, folder, fn, sep='/')
bird <- data.table(read_excel(file_path, sheet = 'Tab3 "a8"'))
bird[, Treatment:=factor(Treatment)]
bird[, Capture_Period:=factor(Nestling_Age)]
bird_wide <- dcast(bird,  Year + Treatment + BandNo + DOY_Initiation + day3mass ~ Capture_Period, value.var=c('Mass','Time'))
bird_wide[, dMass:=Mass_13 - Mass_3]

```

# Reproducibility
## Body Mass
>We found that female body mass significantly decreased between the two capture periods (F1,14.7 = 48.9, P < 0 001; Fig. 2b), but we did not detect a significant effect of either treatment (F2,23 = 1.9, P = 0.173) or a treatment x capture period interaction (F2,15 = 2.5, P = 0.118).

```{r fig2b, fig.cap="Reproduced Fig. 2b"}
# capture period == nestling_age
gg <- ggplot(data=bird, aes(x=Treatment, y=Mass, fill=Capture_Period)) +
  geom_boxplot()
gg
fit <- lmer(Mass ~ Treatment*Capture_Period + (1|BandNo), data=bird)
kable(as.data.frame(anova(fit, ddf="Kenward-Roger")), digits=3)
```

> The mean decrease in body mass between capture periods was significant for females in the control treatment [b = -0.95 (95% CI:  1.75,  0.14), t1,16 = 3.8, P = 0 017] as well as both handicapping treatments [light clipping: b = -1.07 (95% CI:  1.88,  0.26), t1,15 3 = 4.3, P = 0.007; heavy clipping: b = -2.12 (95% CI:  3.67,  0.58), t1,14 3 = 4.5, P = 0.005; Fig. 2b]. 

```{r fib2bChange}
# no adjustment for multiple tests
b_table <- summary(contrast(emmeans(fit, spec=c('Treatment', 'Capture_Period')), method='revpairwise', adjust='none'), infer=c(TRUE,TRUE))
x_rows <- c('1_control,13 - 1_control,3','2_4Fclip,13 - 2_4Fclip,3', '3_8Fclip,13 - 3_8Fclip,3')
b_table <- b_table[which(b_table[,"contrast"]%in%x_rows),]
kable(b_table, digits=3)

# Tukey HSD adjustment reproduces
b_table <- data.table(summary(contrast(emmeans(fit, spec=c('Treatment', 'Capture_Period')), method='revpairwise'), infer=c(TRUE,TRUE)))
x_rows <- c('1_control,13 - 1_control,3','2_4Fclip,13 - 2_4Fclip,3', '3_8Fclip,13 - 3_8Fclip,3')
b_table <- b_table[contrast%in%x_rows,]
kable(b_table, digits=3)
```

>However, the magnitude of decrease in mean body mass of females in the light and heavy clipping treatments was 1.29X (95% CI: 0.6, 2.3) and 2.29X (95% CI: 1.2, 4.5) greater, respectively, that of females in the control treatment.

Fold changes are a type of change (or gain) score and are conditionally biased on the pre-treatment value (see below). Regardless, it's not clear to me how the CIs of the fold-changes were computed and this isn't an easy problem. I did find information [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/16349/how-to-compute-the-confidence-interval-of-the-ratio-of-two-normal-means/16354#16354). Instead, I use a bootstrap to try to reproduce.

```{r fig2bFoldChange, eval=FALSE}
# how many X greater was the reduction (this is a confusing way to report)
niter <- 100
x_levels <- c('Capture_PeriodMass_13', 'Treatment2_4Fclip:Capture_PeriodMass_13', 'Treatment3_8Fclip:Capture_PeriodMass_13')
fold_table <- matrix(NA, nrow=niter, ncol=2)
colnames(fold_table) <- c('clip4', 'clip8')
inc <- 1:nrow(bird_wide)
iter <- 1
while(iter <= niter){
  bird_samp <- na.omit(melt(bird_wide[inc,], id.vars=c('BandNo','Treatment'),
                    measure.vars=c('Mass_3', 'Mass_13'),
                    variable.name = 'Capture_Period',
                    value.name='Mass'))
  #bird_o <- na.omit(orderBy(~BandNo, bird[,.SD,.SDcols=c('Treatment','BandNo','Capture_Period','Mass')]))
  #coefficients(summary(lmer(Mass ~ Treatment*Capture_Period + (1|BandNo), data=bird_o)))

  fit <- lmer(Mass ~ Treatment*Capture_Period + (1|BandNo), data=bird_samp)
  b <- coefficients(summary(fit))
  if(all(x_levels %in% row.names(b))){
    b <- b[x_levels, 'Estimate']
    fold_table[iter,'clip4'] <- (b[1]+b[2])/b[1]
    fold_table[iter,'clip8'] <- (b[1]+b[3])/b[1]
    iter <- iter+1
  }
  
  # resample
  inc <- sample(1:nrow(bird_wide), replace=TRUE)
}

b_table[contrast=='2_4Fclip,13 - 2_4Fclip,3', estimate]/b_table[contrast=='1_control,13 - 1_control,3', estimate]
b_table[contrast=='3_8Fclip,13 - 3_8Fclip,3', estimate]/b_table[contrast=='1_control,13 - 1_control,3', estimate]

apply(fold_table, 2, quantile, c(0.025,0.975))

```

Or, 1.13X and 2.23X more reduction

# Red Flags
## Adjustment for baseline when comparing change in mass
In the linear mixed model, it is the *interaction effect* that contains the difference in mass loss among treatments (so the treatment effect of the change score). Note the inconsistency between the report of 2.29X greater reduction in mass with CI that does not cover 1.0 and the ANOVA table interaction row (both are different ways of looking at the same thing). Fig 2b shows effectively zero effect of treatment for post-treatment measure. The expectation is zero if there is no effect, and the data are very consistent with this. But there is a big difference in pre-treatment mass among levels (again, the expectation is zero with randomized treatment assignment). So this might be a good example of pre-post bias in the estimates of 1.29X and 2.29X greater reduction in mass. [The expectation for these estimates is not 1.0 conditional on pre-treatment mass](https://www.middleprofessor.com/files/quasipubs/change_scores.html). That is, the fold-change that they report is biased, conditional on the pre-treatment mass.

```{r fig2bAncova, fig.cap="ANCOVA style plot"}

# change in mass
gg <- ggplot(data=bird_wide, aes(x=day3mass, y=dMass, color=Treatment)) +
  geom_point()
gg

fit2 <- lm(dMass ~ Mass_3 + Treatment, data=bird_wide)
coefficients(summary(fit2))
```

These results are inconsistent with the LMM where the decrease in mass is actually less for the 4-clip treatment.

```{r fig2b_explore}
# sample size
ycols <- c('Treatment', 'day3mass', 'dMass')
bird_wide[!is.na(dMass), .(N=.N), by=Treatment]

```

Look at their fig 2b which reports sample sizes for pre and post measures. The $n$ drops in all post measures. The ANCOVA only analyzes birds with both pre and post measures so is using less data.
